# measure


This application is designed to use the NIST masscode which has been deliberately left out, but can be modified to use any processing software. 
Furthermore, it relies heavily on a relational database refered to in the code as the "calibration database".
A sql dump of the database structure will be added to this repository at some point.

python dependencies:
-PyQt4
-sqlalchemy
-numpy
-matplotlib
